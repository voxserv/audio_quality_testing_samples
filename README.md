Audio samples for quality tests
===============================

This is a set of audio files built for audio quality testing in
telephony networks, with the tools such as AQuA by Sevana
(http://sevana.biz/).

The "orig" folder contains the original audio downloaded from
freesound.org, distributed under Creative Commons licenses. These audio
files present human speech in studio quality recordings:

available in mono in 48000 Hz (upsampled from 44100Hz originals), 
44100Hz, 16000Hz, and 8000Hz sampling rate:

* test01_20s.wav: 20 seconds test audio, 2 seconds of silence 
  at the start and the end of a file
